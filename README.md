ðŸŽµ Music Player

Welcome to the Music Player repository!
This is a simple and interactive music player built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It allows users to:
	â€¢	âœ… Play, pause, skip to next/previous tracks
	â€¢	âœ… Control volume and track progress
	â€¢	âœ… View song title, artist name, and duration

A great project for practicing DOM manipulation and working with the JavaScript Audio API.
